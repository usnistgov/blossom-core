# Blossom Asset Smart Contracts

There are four APIs that make up the Asset Smart Contracts:

- `ledger` - Initialize the asset ledger.
- `agency` - Manage the agencies registered with Blossom. 
New agencies can request a Blossom account.
- `license` - Manage licenses on the Blossom ledger. This includes adding and removing 
licenses and checking in/out available licenses.
- `swid` - Manage SwID tags that are associated with licenses in Blossom.
